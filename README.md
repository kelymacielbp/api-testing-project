# API testing

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a type of software implementation that allows exposing a backend application to the outside world without the need for access to its source code.

They can be implemented in various ways, one of them is by following an architecture called REST (Representational State Transfer).

The interface documentation of a REST API can be created in various formats. One of the most well-known formats is Swagger. Here we will use this documentation format. We will work using an application named "Shop API". The documentation of this API can be found at http://165.227.93.41/lojinha/lojinha-v2.yml

Tips for testers: It is possible to identify errors during the Swagger analysis.
